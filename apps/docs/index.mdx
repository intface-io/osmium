Osmium is a comprehensive collection of components based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [AI SDK 5](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/) designed to help developers quickly implement chat-with-AI experiences in their applications.

It simplifies the development of AI chat applications by providing pre-built, customizable components that handle the complexities of real-time messaging interfaces. Whether you're building a customer support chatbot, an AI assistant, or any conversational AI application, Osmium gives you the building blocks to get started quickly.

## Core Components

### Chat Component

The heart of Osmium is the Chat component, which consists of three main parts:

- **Message Item**: Renders individual message content with markdown support and copy to clipboard functionality
- **Message List**: Displays conversation history with proper formatting and styling
- **Message Input**: Handles user input with auto-resize, send/stop functionality

## Built-in Features

Osmium comes with carefully crafted UI/UX features specifically tailored for AI chat applications:

### **Scrolling and Spacing Management**

- **Auto Message Spacing**: Automatically manages spacing to leave enough room for upcoming messages, ensuring optimal readability and a smooth conversational flow
- **Auto Scrolling Detection**: Automatically detects whether the user is at the bottom of the conversation and displays a "scroll to bottom" icon when they've scrolled up, enabling quick navigation back to the latest messages
