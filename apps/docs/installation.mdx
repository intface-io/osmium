description: "Learn how to install and set up Osmium components in your project using the shadcn/ui CLI."
---

Osmium follows the [shadcn/ui specification](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry), making it easy to integrate with existing projects. Before installing Osmium components, ensure your project is properly configured with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

## Prerequisites

Make sure your project has been set up correctly with shadcn/ui configuration. If you haven't done this yet, follow the [shadcn/ui installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) to get started.

Your project should have:

- A `components.json` file in your project root
- shadcn/ui dependencies installed
- Proper TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration

## Install Osmium Components

Once your project is configured with shadcn/ui, you can install Osmium components using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://registry.intface.io/chat.json
```

This will download and install the Chat component along with all its dependencies into your `components` directory.

## Import and Use Components

After installation, you can import and use Osmium components in your application:

<Tab title="Code">

```tsx
import Chat from "@/components/chat";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen">
      <Chat
        status={status}
        messages={chatMessages}
        onSend={handleSend}
        onStop={handleStop}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Preview">

<Frame>
  <iframe src="http://localhost:3001/" className="w-full h-[500px]" sandbox />
</Frame>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## What Gets Installed

When you install the Chat component, Osmium will add:

- **Chat component**: The main chat interface
- **Message List**: Displays conversation history
- **Message Input**: Handles user input and submission
- **Required dependencies**: All necessary utilities and types

All components are installed as source code in your project, giving you full control to customize and extend them as needed.
